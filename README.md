# Object_Detection
Object Detection is a Python-based computer vision application that identifies and locates objects in real time using a webcam or images. It uses a trained deep learning model to detect multiple objects, draw bounding boxes, and display their labels, enabling automated recognition for security, monitoring, and smart applications.
